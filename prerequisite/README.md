description: What do you need to run the demo
---

# Prerequisite

To run the demo you need:

* an Ubuntu/Linux machine - you can choose to start an AWS EC2 instance or use a local machine
* python3 and pip3
* UniquID CLI v0.5.4+

To begin, visit our [site](https://uniquid.com) and create a new account. Shortly after, you will receive a verification email: simply click the magic link in the email to complete your subscription and begin!

Once logged in, wait for the initialisation and click the `Create Admin User` button from your console. This will download a `credentials.json` file.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Carefully store the credentials file for future use! You will need it during the next steps.
{% endhint %}
